I am currently a Junior at [**University Of Natural Science**](https://www.hcmus.edu.vn/) majoring in [**Information Technology**](https://www.fit.hcmus.edu.vn/), I am also studying at [**Université Claude Bernard Lyon 1**](https://www.univ-lyon1.fr/en) (double degree).
My research focuses in Information Security/Cyber Security, mostly in Web and Software Security, although I am majoring in Information Technology, however I am always self-learning Information Security/CyberSecurity on Google and others learning sites.
In the near future, I am hoping to be an pentester(penetration testing) or an malware analysis.
